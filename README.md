# Government organisation register data

Data for an alpha register of UK central government organisations — departments, agencies and other organisations with a presence on GOV.UK:

  * [data/government-organisation/government-organisation.tsv](data/government-organisation/government-organisation.tsv)

The term "public sector" or "public body" has a much wider scope than central government organisations covered by this register.
The meaning of "public sector" depends upon context, for example, the Digital Marketplace buyers list includes schools, academies, public corporations and other legal entities such as charities funded by government and recorded in separate registers.

A register needing to reference public sector organisations may use a "public-body", "organisation", "operator" or other field which is a CURIE to one of a number of different registers, including the government-organisation register.

# Maps

Maps assist in the translation of existing codes and names to register records:

| Map | Fields |
| :---         |    :--- |
| [abbreviation](maps/abbreviation.tsv) |Government organisation abbreviations |
| [oscar](maps/oscar.tsv) |[Combined Online Information System (COINS) organisations](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/cy/request/list_of_public_bodies_in_the_coi#incoming-69457) code |
| [govuk](maps/govuk.tsv) |GOV.UK slugs |
| [name](maps/name.tsv) |Government organisation names |

# Lists

The data has been compiled from existing lists of public sector organisations found in a number of different government datasets:
